        <h1>Agriculture</h1>
        <hr>
        <li><span>Agriculture</span> is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops, and raising livestock.
            It includes the preparation of plant and animal products for people to use and their distribution to markets.
        
        </li>
        <p>Agriculture provides most of the world’s food and fabrics. Cotton, wool, and leather are all agricultural products.
         Agriculture also provides wood for construction and paper products.</p>

        <li>Over centuries, the growth of agriculture supported the development of cities. Before agriculture became widespread, 
            hunting and gathering was how people fed themselves. Between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, people gradually learned how 
            to grow cereal and root crops, and settled down to a life based on farming.</li>
         <li>Eventually, much of Earth’s population became dependent on agriculture. Scholars are not sure why this shift to farming
             took place, but it may have occurred because of climate change.</li>

        <li>Many effective agricultural techniques have roots in pre-agricultural human history. For millennia, people have used 
            controlled burning techniques to get rid of brush and debris, allowing edible plants to grow more abundantly and preventing 
            larger wildfires during dry seasons. Today, large wildfires in North America and Australia demonstrate the importance of 
            maintaining controlled burning practices perfected by many Native American tribes and Aboriginal Australian peoples.</li>
        <p> Around <span> 5500 B.C.E.,</span>  farmers in Mesopotamia developed simple irrigation systems. By channeling water from streams onto 
            their fields, farmers were able to settle in areas once thought to be unsuited to agriculture. In Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China, 
            people organized themselves and worked together to build and maintain better irrigation systems.</p>
        <p>
            Early farmers also developed improved varieties of plants. For example, around <span>6000 B.C.E.</span>, a new variety of wheat arose in South
             Asia and Egypt. It was stronger than previous cereal grains, its hulls were easier to remove, and it could be made into bread.

        <li>A period of important agricultural development began in the early <span>1700s</span> for Great Britain and the Low Countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, 
            and the Netherlands, which lie below sea level). New agricultural inventions dramatically increased food production in Europe and
             European colonies, particularly in North America.</li>
        <li>Many machines were developed in the United States. The cotton gin, invented by Eli Whitney in <span>1794</span>, reduced the time needed to
             separate cotton fiber from seed. The invention of the cotton gin was not without negative consequences, however: as cotton became 
             more profitable and less labor-intensive, enslavers had incentive to buy more enslaved people to produce more cotton.</li> 
         <li>Cultures have been breeding animals for centuries. Ancestors of modern sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs were the first 
            livestock to be bred selectively. Farmers began to practice selective breeding on a large scale beginning in 18th century 
            Europe. An early example of this is the Leicester sheep, an animal selectively bred in England for its quality meat and long, 
            coarse wool.</li>
