        <h2>Former Leader Of Proud Boys Gets 22 Years</h2>
        <p>
          Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, was sentenced on
          Tuesday to 22 years in prison for the central role he played in
          organizing a gang of his pro-Trump followers to attack the Capitol on
          Jan. 6, 2021, and stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Tarrio’s sentence, stemming from his conviction this spring on
          charges of seditious conspiracy, was the most severe penalty handed
          down so far to any of the more than 1,100 people charged in connection
          with the Capitol attack — and was likely to remain that way, given
          that no other defendants currently face accusations as serious as the
          ones he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until now, the longest prison term connected to Jan. 6 had been 18
          years. That sentence was issued last week to Ethan Nordean, one of Mr.
          Tarrio’s co-defendants. The same sentence was given in a separate case
          in May to Stewart Rhodes, the leader of another farright group, the
          Oath Keepers militia, who also was found guilty of sedition in
          connection with the storming of the Capitol.
        </p>
        <p>
          The penalty imposed on Mr. Tarrio at a three-hour hearing in Federal
          District Court in Washington was the final sentence to be lodged
          against the five members of the Proud Boys who were tried on seditious
          conspiracy charges earlier this year. Three other men in the case —
          Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola — were each sentenced
          last week to between 10 and 17 years in prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          But of all the sentences handed down so far, Mr. Tarrio’s was the most
          notable — not only because of its length, but also because of what it
          suggested about the current state of the Proud Boys. Within days of
          the Capitol attack, the far-right group became a priority for the
          F.B.I.’s inquiry into Jan. 6 as investigators quickly determined that
          dozens of its members had played decisive roles in breaching
          barricades and assaulting the police.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a series of separate prosecutions — of which Mr. Tarrio’s sedition
          trial was by far the most important — the Justice Department all but
          decapitated the group’s national leadership and mostly put an end to
          its involvement in largescale and often violent pro-Trump rallies in
          cities across the country. But the Proud Boys as a whole survived,
          persisting in their role as “foot soldiers for the right,” in the
          words of one member who testified for the government at Mr. Tarrio’s
          trial. In recent years, the
        </p>

        <p>
          group has repeatedly inserted itself at the local level into conflicts
          over issues like coronavirus restrictions and the teaching of
          antiracism in schools, and has taken part in attacks against
          L.G.B.T.Q. pride events. Explaining why he had imposed 22 years, Judge
          Timothy J. Kelly read aloud the seditious conspiracy statute, noting
          that it was a “serious offense.” Mr. Tarrio, he added, was the
          “ultimate leader of

        <h2>Kenya’s Ability To Pacify Haiti Is Questioned</h2>

        <p>
          Every day, Vélina Élysée Charlier drives past barricaded neighborhoods
          and frequently sees dead bodies lying on the street, she said, a
          result of score-settling between gangs and vigilantes in Haiti’s
          capital. After dusk, she never leaves home for fear of being killed or
          kidnapped.
        </p>
        <p>
          When her 8-year-old daughter got appendicitis one night, Ms. Charlier
          said, the family waited until morning to get her medical care; driving
          to a hospital was out of the question. “Port-au-Prince looks like
          something out of hell these days,” said Ms. Charlier, 42, a prominent
          anticorruption activist in the city and mother of four who lives in a
          hillside area of the capital. As gangs were seizing control of one
          part of Haiti’s capital after another, the country’s fragile
          government issued a plea nearly 12 months ago for foreign troops to
          step in and assert order in the crisis-racked Caribbean nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that desperate appeal, a force led by Kenya finally seems close
          to materializing in what would be the first time an African country
          leads such a mission in one of the Americas’ most unstable places. But
          as Haiti’s security conditions spiral further out of control,
          manifested by a rise in killings around Port-au-Prince as heavily
          armed gangs try to quell a citizenled vigilante movement, many in the
          country disparage the plan as too meager and too late. The criticism
          underscores deep-seated anxieties in Haiti over foreign interventions,
          as well as mistrust of Kenyan security forces over their,

        <h2>Ukraine War Puts a Lever In Kim’s Grip</h2>

        <p>
          SEOUL — For Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, a rare trip to
          Russia this month to discuss military aid for President Vladimir V.
          Putin’s Ukraine war effort could provide two things the North has
          wanted for a long time: technical help with its weapons programs, and
          to finally be needed by an important neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          North Korea has not been used to getting a lot of attention other than
          global condemnation for its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic
          missile tests. But Russia’s urgency to make new gains in the war is
          offering Mr. Kim a bit of the geopolitical spotlight — and a new way
          to both irk the United States and draw closer to Moscow and Beijing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though Russia has long been a crucial ally for the isolated North,
          relations between the two countries have at times grown tense since
          the disintegration of the Soviet Union. And Russia accounts for very
          little of the economic trade that North Korea needs; China alone
          provides nearly all of that. Now, common interests and worldview are
          bringing the neighbors closer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The White House has repeatedly warned that North Korea was starting to
          ship artillery shells and rockets to Russia and negotiating for more
          arms deals. And Western officials’ claims this week that Mr. Kim will
          travel to Russia soon indicate that they fear the process is moving
          forward with more intent. For its part, North Korea faces critical
          technological hurdles in its nuclear and missile programs, as well as
          dire economic need, and Russia could help more on those fronts.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s a win-win situation for both sides,” said Lee Byong-chul, a
          North Korea expert at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at
          Kyungnam University in Seoul. One question hanging over such a deal is
          just how much North Korean aid could move Russia’s war effort forward,
          especially given the North’s economic difficulties and chronic food
          shortages. Mr. Kim recently
